All of my projects. Some were startups, some were projects I was paid for, most are passion projects. 

Currently working on generative AI. 

Key Projects: 
- Open Party - Generative AI/ Mobile development - https://github.com/Liam-Robertson/openparty
- Smart Alarm Project - Firmware, Electronics Engineering - https://github.com/Liam-Robertson/extreme-alarm
- Data Analysis - Python - https://github.com/Liam-Robertson/star-cluster-analysis
- Poem Generator - Desktop Development - https://github.com/Liam-Robertson/poem-generator-electron
- Open Animation - Web Development - https://github.com/Liam-Robertson/open-animation-frontend

Overview: 
- Open Party - Using Generative AI to make local government more transparent - financial analysis/ policy analysis
- Smart Alarm Project - Building a smart alarm clock end to end - with full mobile application, firmware, PCB electronics design, and hardware
- Poem Generator - Built a web application to showcase artist's poetry
- Open Animation - Web application to open source animation projects - allowing artist's to collaborate on animation
- Astrophysics analysis - Using python to analyse star clusters for spiral galaxies

There are lots of other projects as well, but I won't overview them all.  

These projects include anything I'm interested in and have taught myself so there is a wide range of projects and technologies such as: 
- Generative AI (python scripting, Open AI, API, RAG etc)
- Mobile development (kotlin, cross platform, compose etc)
- Firmware (C, hardware, firmware, electronics PCB engineering, 3D printing, bluetooth long distance, ESP32, arduino etc)
- Web Development (Angular, java, scala)
- Desktop applications (typescript, javascript angular)
- Astrophysics work (Python, data analysis)
